# Post Processing Pipeline For Unity

This is a demo project to show some post-processing shaders I can do.

This is made for Unity 2021.3.8f1 using the built-in pipeline.

## Disclaimer

These effects are modular only for ease of experimentation. Once desired effect is found, shaders can be condensed into a singular pass to reduce overdraw and maximize performance.

## Features

* **Pixel Art Effects**
* * Downsampling
* * Dithering
* * Color Palette Swapping

# Examples

## Downsampling, Dithering & Color Grading
